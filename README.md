# Robotics - Universidad Complutense de Madrid (UCM)

Projects and assignments for the Robotics course at UCM, with topics such as: 
- Industrial robots
- Sensing and Perception
- Path planning
- Navigation and autonomous robots

## Practice 1 (Pr치ctica 1 -Motores I) 
Consists of familiarizing yourself with the Raspberry Pi and doing simple operations such as controlling a LED or a stepper motor.

## Practice 2 (Pr치ctica 2 -Motores II) 
Consists of learning how the servomotors and the PWM work.

## Practice 3 (Pr치ctica 1 - Sensores I) 
Consists of learning how to do simple operations such as controlling a LED or a servo motor.

## Practice 4 (Pr치ctica 2 - Sensores II) 
Aims to use different types of sensors with a Raspberry Pi and how to use the microchip mcp3008.

## Practice 5 (Proyecto Final - Robot) 
Deals with the construction of a robot. The goal was to construct a line tracking robot and a obstacle avoidance robot. It will follow complex routes and detect and avoid obstacles.

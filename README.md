Practice 1 (Pr치ctica 1 -Motores I) consists of familiarizing yourself with the Raspberry Pi and doing simple operations such as controlling a LED or a stepper motor.

Practice 2 (Pr치ctica 2 -Motores II) consists of leaning how the servomotors and the PWM work.

Practice 3 (Pr치ctica 1 - Sensores I) consists of learning how the doing simple operations such as controlling a LED or a servo motor.

Practice 4 (Pr치ctica 2 - Sensores II) aims to use different types of sensors with a Raspberry Pi and how to use the microchip mcp3008 .

Practice 5 (Proyecto Final - Robot) deals with the construction of a robot. The goal was to construct a line tracking robot and a obstacle avoidance robot. It will follow complex routes and detect and avoid obstacles.
